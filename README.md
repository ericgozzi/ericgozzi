Hi, I’m Eric Gozzi, an architect and computational designer who spends more time staring at reflections than I'd care to admit. Currently based in Zürich, I’m navigating the world of architecture through a Master’s program at ETH Zurich.

I started my journey at EPF Lausanne, where I managed to get a Bachelor’s in Architecture without completely losing my sanity. Then, I took off for Hamburg and Berlin, where I gained some valuable working experience and figured out how to order a good coffee in more languages.

When I’m not designing buildings or getting lost in code, you can find me training for my next triathlon—because who doesn’t want to run, swim, and bike all before lunch? And if I’m not burning calories, I’m probably in the kitchen, experimenting with recipes (spoiler: I love making pasta).

So, whether I’m designing the next big thing, sweating through a triathlon, or cooking up a storm, I’m always looking for new ways to push boundaries—except when it comes to dessert, that’s sacred.
